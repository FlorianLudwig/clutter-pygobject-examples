This project is simply a repository of code examples that I am working on as I
learn Clutter and pygobject together. I have no idea (and make no assertions)
as to whether they will be helpful for anyone else, though I will try and do my
best to write them within such standards that they eventually get placed into a
Gnome repository elsewhere.

Here are some crucial things to bear in mind before trying to work with any of
this code:

	1) I use Python3; I just do. Eventually I will go back and resolve
	issues with Python2.7. Moving forward and all that.

	2) You will need the Clutter.py "overrides" file which, depending on
	the date, may or may not be available on your system. To find out
	whether or not you have it, run:

	# python -c 'import gi; print(gi._overridesdir)'

	...and see if the file is there. If not, you can use a copy I've
	included in the etc directory or fetch it directly from the Gnome
	pyclutter git repository:

	http://git.gnome.org/browse/pyclutter/plain/introspection/Clutter.py?h=wip/introspection

	3) The code in tests may use deprecated/unencouraged APIs. As I
	discover culprits I will squash them, but I make no promises.

	4) Besides Clutter.py, the scripts in etc are simple things I
	personally use for debugging. Ignore them, please.
